# Tantalizing-Textiles-Flagship

## Intro
Currently, Tantalizing Textiles operates with one store in each state within the United States of America. With expectations for growth, upper management wants to get a head start and begin to plan how they can save shipping costs and engage better with customers in their physical stores. As of today, all shipped orders made on Tantalizing Textiles’ website are packaged up and sent out to customers from their lone shipment warehouse in the greater Los Angeles area. 

They have come up with the idea of expanding one store within each of the four regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) of the country that will serve as flagship stores to offer a more enhanced in-store shopping experience, in addition to serving as each region’s inventory warehouse from which items get shipped to customers that have chosen to have their purchases delivered to them.
